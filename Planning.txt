- Plan out 3 levels
	- Use provided music to help pace-out levels
		- Sync gameplay transitions to musical transitions
		- Sync gameplay with the music rhythm when possible
	- Remember, constant action is quickly exhausting or desensitizing 
		- Instead, we need bursts of action with ramping intensity, separated by brief moments of calm for the player to recover and reorient themselves
		- Add rests:
			- At level beginnings
			- After (and to lesser extent before) mid-boss fights
			- Before and after main bosses
			- Small rests between boss phases
			- After intense enemy sequences
			- During major shifts in environment and level design
		- Keep the rests from becoming tedious for players that don't need them
			- Merge rests where possible (e.g. rest after intense enemy sequence is also the rest before a boss fight)
			- Resting doesn't mean nothing is happening, just that the player doesn't feel expected to do much or provide their focused attention (give them something to look at)
				- Have interesting things in the background
					- See boss approach in the background before it appears in the foreground
					- See what storytelling you can do with things happening in the background
				- Play animations
					- Maybe a boss plays an animation or changes stance between different phases
					- Fade in to new levels or play some type of level intro if doing a seemless transition
				- Present the player with info
					- Level title overlay at beginning of the level during the intro or during a major transition
					- Level score details at end of level
				

- Critical functionality
	- Enemy movement control
		- Movement path designation
		- Facing direction animation
		- Fire signal
			- Fire pattern designation
		- Aim mode designation






Projectile types
	- Pellet - slow, round 
	- Bolt - fast, narrow
	- Missile - tracking, limited turn speed, runs out of fuel
	- Unguided missile - changes speed and trajectory over time
	- Bomb - moves for a while then explodes
		- Energy bomb - explosion damages large area around it, telegraph explosion radius with charge up particle effect
		- Shrapnel bomb - explosion shoots out pellets in radius
	- Laser 	- instant, charge up delay, telegraph position with laser pointer or particle effects
		- Player tracking needs to stop long enough before firing to allow player to dodge
	- Mines - slow, track player precisely or just explode after time, limited lifetime
		- Maybe these can also be directed into enemies after their initial activation 

Implied goals
	- Destroy all enemies
	- Avoid getting hit
	- Power up ship
	- Complete timed segments as quickly as possible
	- Get high score
	- Pacifist/No-shoot runs?
		- Maybe provide bonus score or change gameplay sequences (probably beyond the scope of this project)

Risk vs. Reward
	- Distance?
		- Being closer does more damage but leaves less time to react and has tighter bullet grouping
		- Maybe some attacks are easier to dodge if the player is brave and moves very close to the enemy
		- Enemies that expose a vulnerability while preparing a big attack
			- Need to either stay far away or do enough damage up close to prevent the attack  
	

Unorganized Ideas
	- Wake-up animation
		- Change to be just the eye to be more generally useful
		- Turrets/enemies that have an activation proximity
		- Small turrets
		- Mines
			- Seeker mines
				- Destroy after time or maybe you have to use the environment like in an asteroid field
				- Maybe they can be used to also destroy enemies
		- Enemies that activate only when fired at
		- Boss phase activation
	- Small sprites of just blocks to make destructible parts
		- Network of structural dependencies so that they break apart instead of floating
		- Destructible armor for some enemies/bosses
		- Build larger multi-part ships
		- Build static structure lattices for environmental enemy structures
			- Desaturate to distinguish what is in background vs foreground
	- Blocker type enemies
		- High health but don’t attack
			- Act as shields around other enemies
		- Add guns along outside for radial shooting patterns
	- Missiles
		- Enemy missiles track player with limited turning force (they overshoot the player and fly off screen when dodged)
			- Physics based approach w/ lateral vs tangential acceleration components
				- Lateral tries to steer towards player, tangential is always applied
				- Lateral (turning) force needs to scale with the current speed
				- Limited time before acceleration runs out (stops turning and accelerating)
		- Player missiles can potentially be more forgiving, with more precise seeking
	- Mini-turrets / Point defense
		- Small free-floating turrets or orbs that fire independent of enemy facing direction
		- Destroyed only when the parent is destroyed
	- Shields
		- Damageable shields the player has to destroy first
			- Shield used to protect other weak ships and must be destroyed first
		- Timed shields that the player needs to avoid shooting 
			- Absorber shield that absorbs shots to charge up a weapon
				- Maybe while enemy is preparing to fire, the shield is up and absorbed shots strengthen the final weapon
				- Maybe too many absorbed shots overheat the weapon
				- Risk vs. reward aspect - avoid shooting the shield to face a weaker attack, vs. attack shield to overheat/destroy enemy with risk of bigger attack on failure 
		- Deflector shield that deflects shots as hostile bullets
			- Maybe also slows down shots to make it easier for the player
				- Maybe neutral bullets instead so the player can bounce shots off of them
		- Different shields need to be disinguishable visually
		- Special player attack that can bypass shields
			- Missiles that go through shields - ignore shields
			- Fast, small pulse that goes through shields - bypass shields to try and hit shield generator
			- Beam that damages shields - break through shields
			- Emp blast that drops shields temporarily - limited window to destroy shield generator or do damage
	- Midground enemies
		- Can be flown over without damage
		- Turret emplacements
		- Harmless environment that is destroyable for points / pickups
		- Enemy structures
			- Eyes that follow player movement
		- Need to clearly telegraph what is and isn’t in the midground
			- Midground parallax box that the player knows they don’t collide with
			- Objects need to appear to move with the midground parallax
			- Desaturate sprites
			- Make things smaller
	- Pickups
		- What to drop
			- Power-ups that give player stronger weapons
			- Tokens that give the player extra points
			- Extra lives
		- How to drop
			- Get from sufficient score (e.g. lives bonus from high enough score)
			- Formations where every enemy needs to be destroyed to drop
			- Rare large enemies
			- Hidden in specific destructibles
				- Rewards player for destroying everything
				- Con: this may distract the player from the primary gameplay; destroying some things may be fun, but having to try destroying everything to find secrets may just be tedious
				- Maybe this can be counteracted by having some telegraph as to where secrets are hidden



- Boss sequences
	- 1 or 2 Midboss  ~20s 
	- 2 Bosses   75s - 100s
