=== Minor Changes ================
- Player death effect changed to not loop
- ShootingController no longer allows the player to fire a single shot while paused
- UI Backdrop switched from scaled image to 9-slice
- Camera made to render at 3:4 aspect ratio to emulate arcade shmups
	- UI and viewport rescale to preserve the correct aspect ratio at arbitrary resolutions
	by letterboxing or pillarboxing
- Added delay before player respawning
	- Separated out damage and respawn invincibility times
- Changed player hitbox to be a small central core
- Enemy explosion changed to not loop
- Enemy projectiles changed to be larger pellets for visibility
- Locked player movement to the bounds of the screen area
- Changed projectiles and effects to be pooled using a small pooling package I wrote previously
- Projectiles now despawn after leaving the screen instead of on a timer
- Added intermediary classes to SFX to keep them from playing multiple times per frame to prevent volume problems
- Changed backgrounds to be tiled
- Script to make the background scroll
- Lengthened player projectiles to reduce flashing
- Added two variants to player fire sound to reduce repetitiveness
- Added backgrounds of just stars moving at different speeds to create a sense of parallax


=== External / Reverted Changes ===
- Pooling code refactored


=== Timeline changes ===
- Added annotation, jump, and destination marker classes from Unity sample code: https://github.com/needle-mirror/com.unity.timeline
- Added a custom type of track and clip to control enemy behaviour
	- Controls enemy movement, facing, player tracking, and shooting
- Added a basic bezier spline implementation from example code at: https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/curves-and-splines/
	- Spline modifications:
		- Added editor functions to insert and remove curve segments
		- Added computations to compute arc lengths and reparameterize X(t) to X(u) where u is the scaled arc length
		- Added LineRenderer generation code to resolve problem with gizmos not rendering for control track spawned objects

- Created ScriptableObjects to hold projectile patterns and sequences
	- Created custom property drawers to make editing easier
	- Changed shooting controller to be switchable between firing single projectiles, patterns of projectiles, and timed sequences
